# TODOs for floorplan editor.

* Restrict floorplan to a single room, the deck.

* Rename Room to Floor

* Prevent illegal operations to floorplans (edge crossing, zero area)

* undo

* Take active code and listeners out of walls and corners.  Make Room/Floorplan immutable.

* Make editing operations atomic, i.e. a long convoluted move should not have creeping changes parts not
  explicitly being edited.

* explicit posts instead of corners.  Add implicit posts to long walls.

* Improve editing experience; don't require button presses.  Make it make sense
